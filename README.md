# youtube-clone
Starting making it again as I want to add new features but the main reason was to make the code reusable for myself, you can check my old YouTube Clone project here:- https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/YouTube-Clone-Old

What I have made in this:-
1. Responsive Clone.
2. Dark Mode (Click On The Moon In Nav Bar For Dark Mode).
3. Upload Feature (Click On Upload Icon).
4. In Upload, we can only use link for image and channel logo, currently no video can be uploaded as because of no database.
