Short Brief:-
YouTube Clone with Dark Mode, and Smooth Transitions, with a custom upload feature (not what you are expecting), to upload a custom video, just click on the upload icon, and to go back click on the YouTube logo or back button, thanks.

Note:- Upload Page not designed well because busy learning React, check this project if you think I can't make the page beautiful:- https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/karafuru-clone.

Long Brief:-
I have already made a YouTube clone which was my first ever project made with HTML, CSS, and JS/jQuery, you can have a look at it if you want:- https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/youtube-clone-old. The reason to recreate this is because of neat & clean & reusable code with Smooth Transitions, and Upload feature.

Features I Added In This:-
1. Responsive Design.
2. Smooth Transitions.
3. Dark Mode (Click On The Moon In Nav Bar For Dark Mode).
4. Upload Feature (Click On Upload Icon).
5. In Upload, we can only use link for channel logo, but for thumbnail we can link, or the Choose File Image from which we can upload image from our Device/Local Storage, currently no video can be uploaded as because of no database. Note:- Make sure use 1920x1080 or 1280x720 dimensions, yeah I can make that dimension checker, but told you busy learning React
6. Generate Random link for the video or use custom links, and same for this, if links are same it will not detect because I have not made that feature just because yeah I told you, busy learning React.

Something I Want To Say:-
Yeah, this is a rework project for my Portfolio. I may start working on this in future, but this was the end for it, because yeah, I told you, busy learning React.
